todo functions:

>crossover
Takes two chromosomes (parents) and returns a pair of chromosomes (children).
Randomly chooses a crossover point to exchange genes (bits) of two parents.

>mutate
Takes  a chromosome, returns nothing
In a loop the function randomly generates a number between 0.0 and 1.0.
If this number exceedes the decared mutation rate value, then the gene (bit) changes its value.

>findBest
Takes a vector of chromosomes (a population), returns a chromosome.
Compares the best fitness score of each chromosome (individual) and returns the best chromosome.
